            <h1>thanks</h1>
            <p>im a bit late to this whole "thanksgiving" thing</p>
            <p>i was not born in the USA, im dominican<br>im from the dominican republic<br>so we <em>technically</em> don't have to celebrate thanksgiving</p>
            <p>yet, we still celebrate it at school</p>
            <p>usually, we had a little play about the native americans and the whole<br>tea thing, it's been a while since we have had this kind of event at school,<br>which is why i can't remember it very well</p>
            <p>this year, like last year, we had to write a letter to those people that we deem<br>important, thanking them for multiple things: for living, for helping us, for being<br>there when we need them</p>
            <p>but unlike last year, i decided to dedicate my letter to two people that<br>are very special to me</p>
            <p>two people that, have always been there when i needed them the most</p>
            <p>and no<br>they are not my parents<br>i <em>do not</em> care about them</p>
            <p><em>that's a story for another time</em></p>
            <hr />
            <p>those people are my two girlfriends</p>
            <p><em>yes im poly please stop asking if i am</em></p>
            <p>and i think that, even if you don't celebrate thanksgiving<br>or think that we shouldn't even celebrate thanksgiving due to it's...</p>
            <p><em>quite bloody history</em></p>
            <p>you should still thank your loved ones</p>
            <p>not just on thanksgiving, but every day</p>
            <p>heck you can even have one of those "gratitude journals" if you so want</p>
            <p>whatever floats your boat<br>just<br>thank the people that you love<br>thank the people that you care about<br>thank the people that made you a better person<br>thank the people that you adore<br>thank the people thatâ€”<br>thank people</p>
            <h2>some people im grateful for</h2>
            <ul><li>Ashley and Cindy for being two of the best people i've ever met</li>
            <li>Lu "Todepond" Wilson, Paul "insert" Makles, Vale, and Jennifer for teaching me new, interesting things every day</li>
            <li>V3sper, S7rayCat, Junie, Illy and Amber for being wonderful friends</li>
            <li>And you, for reading this post</li></ul>
