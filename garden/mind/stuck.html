<p>hi it's been a while since my last post</p>
<p>you might be wondering, what happened to that promise you made on your first post?</p>
<p>well, let's say that life has different plans for me</p>
<h2>you see, this year has been rough so far</h2>
<p>i'm sure you know all about the terrible and dystopian things that the united states' current president has done in this short period</p>
<p>and i am someone who really worries about her friends. i mean, i have to, it's like i owe them something even though i don't.</p>
<p>i had a writer's block and couldn't write about anything in that period of time.</p>
<h2>unblocking</h2>
<p>i've tried many things to "unblock" myself, those being</p>
<ul><li>creating a separate journal to vent about my daily life</li>
<li>and being more open about my life to my friends and relatives</li></ul>
<p>but none of those have really helped me a lot</p>
<p>i stopped writing in that journal 3 days in, and being more open meant that i was getting the usual reactions from my friends</p>
<p>nothing really changed</p>
<h2>but then</h2>
<p>but then something clicked</p>
<p>i started to <em>draw</em></p>
<p>for those who haven't been following me for the past 2 years, i am a furry artist</p>
<p>i draw furries because i identify myself with cats, and by that i mean that i love cats so much that, if given the opportunity, i would be an anthro cat</p>
<p>but i haven't drawn in a very long time<br>only now i started to draw again<br>which means that i am rusty<br>which means that i had toâ€”</p>
<h2>practice</h2>
<p>because</p>
<p></p><blockquote>"practice makes perfect"</blockquote><p></p>
<p>i stopped drawing because it felt like i wasn't improving at all<br>it felt like i was <em>stuck</em>,<br><span class="smaller">it felt like i</span> <em>couldn't get better</em><br><span class="smaller">it felt like it</span> <em>was a waste of time</em></p>
<p>but it wasn't</p>
<p>i was getting better, i just didn't have enough feedback to notice</p>
<h2>so maybe, maybe i could change</h2>
<p>maybe i could share my posts, get feedback, improve, grow</p>
<h2>and numbers don't matter</h2>
<p>they don't<br>to me, they are like if they weren't there<br>all i need is feedback from people, not from a machine</p>
<h2>back to the drawing board</h2>
<p>so, when art class came up today, i felt an urge to write <em>something</em></p>
<p>it could be anything, really<br>this is my garden after all, anything goes<br>even drafts if i want<br>it's not meant to be a place to talk about any specific topic</p>
<p>but this has been on my mind for quite a while, and i wanted to get it out of my system</p>
<p>i don't like being stuck, i want to <em>flow</em><br>i want to write things that might not make sense, but make sense to me<br>maybe, maybe, someone understands how i'm feeling<br>maybe not<br>and that's fine</p>
<p>in times of uncertainty, it's important to never give up<br>specially now, when the world might need you</p>
<p>now, go take a nice break at my <a href="/garden" class="link blue">garden</a>, you might need it</p></div>  <style> .smaller { font-size: .5em; opacity: 75%; } div.center-everything { max-width: 50%; display: grid; justify-content: center; } @media screen and (max-width: 700px) { div.center-everything { max-width: 100%; justify-content: left; margin: 5px; } } h1 { font-size: 3em; } body { background-color: #2e1a29; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Inter', 'Noto Color Emoji', sans-serif; color: white; } ul { padding-left: 1.5ch; } ul li:not(:first-child):has(a) { margin-top: .3rem; } .link.red { padding-inline: 5px; background-color: #d4fa16; font-weight: 700; color: black; } .link.blue { padding-inline: 5px; background-color: #dcbff6; font-weight: 700; color: black; } .link.green { padding-inline: 5px; background-color: #5938ff; font-weight: 700; color: white; } .link { text-decoration: underline; width: fit-content; } .link.accent { color: #ee225f; text-decoration-style: wavy; } hr { justify-self: left; width: 100%; margin-top: 15px; height: 4px; border: none; border-bottom: 4px solid white; opacity: .1; } h2::after { content: ""; display: block; width: 100%; height: 2px; margin-top: 5px; background-color: #fff; opacity: .2; } blockquote { border-left: 2px solid #ffc9ec; margin-left: 0; padding-left: 2rem; color: #ffc9ec; } </style> </body></html>
