			<description><![CDATA[<h1>I became a bunny</h1><p>Yeah, I am now one.</p><p>This means no more meowing. No more purring. Pure body language and maybe some grunting.</p><p>I always thought I was a cat, from my core. People I love always told me that I behaved like one, probably for all the wrong reasons, but I took it to heart. After all, I did like cats, and I still do! But—</p><p>You might be wondering, what about your username? It says “catgirl”, you are no longer a catgirl, right? Yeah, correct. But that does not mean I should change it. Just because it says “cat” it means that I must “cat”, it gives the impression that I “cat”, which I did! But now I don't. And—</p><p><em>Gestures to a nearby whiteboard</em></p><p>It doesn't mean that I am restricted to whatever bunnies do, I am flexible after all. I change a lot. One day you might see me going completely non-verbal, and the other day I might do the complete opposite thing. After all, it's not like—</p><p>Oh, what made me change all of the sudden? A random thought. One of those weird ideas I have. The usual.</p><p>I guess it had something to do with trading names with one of my girlfriends who just happened to have a similar name to mine, maybe that was a catalyst. Can't be for certain, though.</p><p>Anyway, <a class="link green" href="/garden">how are my flowers doing?</a></p>]]></description>
