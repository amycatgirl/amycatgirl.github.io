            <p>what do you see</p>
            <p>a place?</p>
            <h2>focus</h2>
            <p>what are you thinking</p>
            <p>what? girls?</p>
            <h2>focus</h2>
            <p>what are you doing</p>
            <p>writing? coding? writing a novel?</p>
            <p>skipping homework? having a mental breakdown?</p>
            <p>trying to focus?</p>
            <h2>focus</h2>
            <p>how do i focus on something?<br>it's hard to focus on one specific thing</p>
            <p>well<br>for me, at least</p>
            <p>you see, this has been the case for a few years now and<br>i was wondering if it had something to do with<br>my brain</p>
            <p>i tried reaching out to my parents, telling them what<br>i felt was wrong with me</p>
            <p>i tried reaching out to my school counsellor, telling them what i felt was wrong with me</p>
            <p>i tried reaching out<br>to my teachers,<br>telling them what i felt<br>was wrong with me</p>
            <p>they all shrugged it off as something that i was<br>making up in my mind</p>
            <h2>lies</h2>
            <p>since i was little, i've always been a cheeky little liar<br>making things up<br>imagining my own little world</p>
            <p>as i grew older and older, i kept lying and lying<br>not really thinking about what would happen<br>if people knew i was lying to them this whole time</p>
            <p>i was fearing that my reputation was going to fall off</p>
            <p>and i had to do something</p>
            <h2>but i didn't</h2>
            <p>and i kept lying<br>and i kept getting caught</p>
            <h2>truth</h2>
            <p>what does this have to do with me not being able to focus?</p>
            <p>nothing, it has nothing to do with that</p>
            <p>i eventually realised that, i could do something<br>i could, you know, tell... the truth??<br>(why i didn't think about this earlier is beyond me)</p>
            <p>so i did<br>i started telling the truth<br>but no one trusted me</p>
            <p>it was, well, too late</p>
            <h2>focus</h2>
            <p>i got sidetracked again, didn't i</p>
            <p>anyway, as i was saying</p>
            <p>i can't focus on one thing very well</p>
            <p>and i've had a few suspicions on why that is</p>
            <p>but i don't want to self-diagnose myself<br>to not create any bias in my favour</p>
            <p>but i can't get a therapist myself<br>my parents wouldn't let me<br>i can't just go anywhere, im basically tied to my house</p>
            <hr>
            <p>well, time to focus, maybe this time i can actually do the task<br>i was given</p>
            <p>surely i won't get sidetracked againâ€”</p>
