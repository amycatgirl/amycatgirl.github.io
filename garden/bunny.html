        <p>Yeah, I am now one.</p>
        <p>This means no more meowing. No more purring. Pure body language and maybe some grunting.</p>
        <p>I always thought I was a cat, from my core. People I love always told me that I behaved like one, probably for all the wrong reasons, but I took it to heart. After all, I did like cats, and I still do! But—</p>

        <p>I guess it had something to do with trading names with one of my girlfriends who just happened to have a similar name to mine, maybe that was a catalyst. Can't be for certain, though.</p>
